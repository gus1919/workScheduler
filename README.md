# workScheduler

In this project, were to add a current date function and a table representing the work day (I used 7am to 7pm).  From there, you could enter text into the time blocks and the blocks would be color coded based on thre time in the day.  The information would be stored locally so that if the screen is refreshed, the data persists.
